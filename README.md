Whitepages Pro API Examples
===========

Find Person (ASP.NET)
Find a Person allows you to query the WhitePages Pro databases and request all the records relating to a person at an address. You’d use Find a Person anywhere you’d need to look up an individual and return the phone, locations, and business related to it.

Reverse Address (ASP.NET)
Find by Address allows you to query the Whitepages Pro databases and request all the records relating to a given street address.

Reverse Phone (ASP.NET)
This sample app demonstrates the Reverse Phone Whitepages Pro API request. By simply entering a phone number you can request all of the records related to that phone number, including people, locations, and businesses.

Phone Reputation Lookup (ASP.NET)
This app simulates a simple situation where you’d like to find out whether or not a given phone number is likely to be a source of spam, or not. The Reverse Phone identity solution from the Whitepages Pro API gives you fine-grained reputation information that can be used to make a decision.

Call Center Routing (ASP.NET)
This sample app shows a simple hypothetical call center interface, where incoming calls are automatically sorted using custom business rules. By inspecting various pieces of metadata returned from the Reverse Phone API call, such as Line Type, Reputation Level, etc., we can prioritize the incoming call list and maximize the effectiveness of an agent’s time.

Data Cleansing (ASP.NET)
This example runs an uploaded CSV file containing contact information through a data cleansing process that uses the Whitepages Pro Find Person API to obtain the most recent information for a given person, given an old address. The use of the is_historical flag on the API request allows you to query the Whitepages databases using out-of-date information.

Find Person (Java Servlet/JSP)
Find a Person allows you to query the WhitePages Pro databases and request all the records relating to a person at an address. You’d use Find a Person anywhere you’d need to look up an individual and return the phone, locations, and business related to it.

Reverse Address (Java Servlet/JSP)
This sample app uses the Reverse Address Whitepages Pro API feature to request all of the records associated with a given street address.

Reverse Phone (Java Servlet/JSP)
This sample app demonstrates the Reverse Phone Whitepages Pro API request. By simply entering a phone number you can request all of the records related to that phone number, including people, locations, and businesses.

Send Gift with Address Auto Append (iOS)
This sample app demonstrates a hypothetical situation where you’d like to be able to look up a person and their address based only on the name and a portion of the address (such as city and state, or postal code). With just a few details and with the help of the Whitepages Pro API, such an app becomes possible.

Contact Form Fill (Android)
This example Android app demonstrates a hypothetical workflow where you would like to be able to allow your users to register for the service using only their phone number, instead of having to enter their name and other identifying information by hand. By providing a quick and easy-to-use search mechanism that leverages the power of the Whitepages Pro API, you can enable such a scenario.
