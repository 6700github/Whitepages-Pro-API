OVERVIEW

Identity score queries for identity scores and score name.

HOW TO COMPILE SAMPLES:
======================
1- If using Visual Studio 2012, open WhitePagesPersonLookup.sln solution and build it.
2- For Visual Studio 2013, open WhitePagesPersonLookup.sln instead. Also, see NOTES below regarding web.config changes.
3- In Solution Explorer, use Set As Start Page to set Personlookup.aspx and set WhitePagesPersonLookup as StartUp 
   Project as an entry point.

HOW TO RUN SAMPLES:
==================

1- With ASP.NET Development Server (Visual Studio built-in)
2- Open the solution in Visual Studio.
3- If not done before, set Personlookup.aspx as start page and set WhitePagesPersonLookup as StartUp Project so that 
   it would load automatically instead of directory listing.
4- Start the solution.

NOTES:
=====
The samples for Visual Studio 2012 use the same sets of source code files. web.config files for these versions, 
however, should be a bit different. If you're on Visual Studio 2013, follow instructions in web.config to make 
it compatible with Visual Studio 2013 requirements.
