This app is written for Xamarin Studio 5.9.8 on Mac OS X 10.11 (El Capitan).

The app is dependent on a NuGet package, called "ProApiLibrary", version 1.3.0. This is a PCL (Portable Code Library) C# library that contains the code to connect to the Pro API.

ProApiLibrary is itself dependend on NewtonSoft's JSON.NET library, which is also available as a NuGet package.
